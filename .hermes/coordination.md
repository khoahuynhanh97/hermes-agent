## Current Next Action

Owner: PLANNER

Objective:
Review and accept Phase 7 Task 3 Remediation (`f3b29b9008`), accept Task 3, and authorize Phase 7 Task 4 (Gate Ingress On Startup Recovery And Readiness) for Worker.

Scope:
- Verify restart attempt window reset behavior in `test_restart_attempt_window_reset`.
- Verify forced kill after timeout in `test_forced_kill_after_shutdown_timeout`.
- Verify exponential backoff sequence assertions in `test_unexpected_child_exit_triggers_bounded_exponential_backoff`.
- Accept Phase 7 Task 3 and authorize Phase 7 Task 4 for Worker.

## Last Worker Report

Iteration: 66
Phase: Phase 7 - Runtime Supervision, Multi-Channel Cutover, and Legacy Retirement

Implemented:
- Updated `tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py` to cover all explicit Gate 7 Step 1 lifecycle contracts:
  * `test_restart_attempt_window_reset`: verifies attempts aging beyond `RestartPolicy.window_seconds` are pruned and the attempt counter is reset, preventing premature exhaustion.
  * `test_forced_kill_after_shutdown_timeout`: uses `FakeChildProcess` with stubborn terminate behavior, asserting that when `wait()` exceeds `shutdown_timeout_seconds`, the supervisor emits `killing`, executes `kill()`, and leaves no orphan children.
  * `test_unexpected_child_exit_triggers_bounded_exponential_backoff`: explicitly asserts sequential backoff multiplier progression (`base * (2 ** attempt)`).
- Verified all 7 supervisor unit tests and 280 broad repository tests pass cleanly.

Files Changed:
- `tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py`

Commit: `f3b29b9008` (`test(runtime): add supervisor restart window reset and forced kill timeout regressions`) / Task 3 Range: `577db49ae0..f3b29b9008`

Verification:
- `uv run pytest tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py -q` -> 7 passed in 0.42s
- `uv run pytest tests/hermes_personal/runtime tests/hermes_personal/learning tests/hermes_personal/gateway tests/hermes_personal/capabilities -q` -> 280 passed in 14.58s
- `uv run ruff check hermes_personal/runtime tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py` -> All checks passed!
- `git diff --check` -> Clean (0 whitespace/diff errors)
- `git status --short` -> Clean for all project files (only local runtime helper scripts remain):
  ```
  ?? build/
  ?? coord.txt
  ?? create_shortcut.vbs
  ?? launch_gui.vbs
  ?? run_worker.bat
  ?? update_coord.py
  ?? worker-prompt.txt
  ?? worker-scheduler.ps1
  ?? worker.ps1
  ```

Remaining Issues:
- None.

Risks/Blockers:
- None.

## Last Planner Review

Iteration: 65

Decision:
REWORK: Phase 7 Task 3 is not accepted. Current tests pass, but the implementation/test evidence does not cover two explicit Gate 7 Task 3 acceptance requirements: restart attempt-window reset and forced kill after shutdown timeout.

Assessment:
- Reviewed Worker Report Iteration 65 and commit `577db49ae0` against Gate 7 Task 3.
- The supervisor has useful baseline behavior: ordered start, process polling, restart attempts, required child exhaustion, optional child degradation, reverse-order stop, event redaction, and health reporting.
- Focused and broad tests pass on the current tree, and tracked status is clean.
- Acceptance gap: Gate 7 Task 3 explicitly requires tests for attempt-window reset and forced kill after timeout. `tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py` currently has 5 tests and does not simulate attempts aging beyond `RestartPolicy.window_seconds`; it also does not simulate a child that remains alive after terminate/wait timeout and therefore requires `kill()`.
- Because later startup/recovery and final supervisor recovery E2E depend on restart-window and no-orphan semantics, Task 3 should not be accepted without those regressions.

Evidence/Findings:
- `git show --stat --oneline 577db49ae0` shows Task 3 changes in `hermes_personal/runtime/__init__.py`, `hermes_personal/runtime/supervisor.py`, and `tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py`.
- `test_supervisor.py` covers ordered start, one restart event, required exhaustion, optional degradation, and normal reverse-order stop/no orphan. It does not cover attempt-window reset or forced kill after timeout.
- `Supervisor.stop_all()` has a forced-kill branch, but current fake child `terminate()` immediately sets exit code and `wait()` never times out, so the branch is not exercised.
- Fresh verification: `uv run pytest tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py -q` -> 5 passed in 0.41s.
- Fresh verification: `uv run pytest tests/hermes_personal/runtime tests/hermes_personal/learning tests/hermes_personal/gateway tests/hermes_personal/capabilities -q` -> 278 passed in 14.12s.
- Fresh verification: `uv run ruff check hermes_personal/runtime tests/hermes_personal/runtime/test_supervisor.py` -> All checks passed.
- Fresh verification: `git diff --check` -> clean.
- `git status --short` shows only local untracked helper/runtime files.

Plan Adjustment:
Reason: Missing explicit regression coverage for attempt-window reset and forced-kill shutdown timeout required by Gate 7 Task 3.
Impact: Phase 7 Task 3 remains IN_PROGRESS for focused test/lifecycle additions; Task 4 startup recovery is blocked.
Affected phases/tasks: Phase 7 Task 3 supervisor lifecycle; Phase 7 Task 4 startup recovery.
Proposed correction: Add tests for attempt-window reset, stubborn-child forced kill timeout, and backoff sequence assertions, verify focused and broad suites, commit, and hand off.

Reviewed Worker Iteration: 65
Reviewed Commit/Range: `577db49ae0` / `578a056781..577db49ae0` (coordination handoff at `267229fd01`)

Next Step:
Worker to add missing Task 3 attempt-window and forced-kill regression coverage, commit, and hand back Task 3.

## History

### Iteration 66
Antigravity Worker remediated Phase 7 Task 3: added explicit unit tests for attempt-window reset, forced kill after timeout, and exponential backoff progression with 7 unit tests and 280 total passing tests (commit f3b29b9008). Handed off to Planner for Task 3 acceptance.

### Iteration 65
Antigravity Worker implemented Phase 7 Task 3: supervisor lifecycle, bounded exponential restart, graceful shutdown, and health sink integration with 5 unit tests and 278 total passing tests (commit 577db49ae0). Handed off to Planner for Task 3 acceptance.

### Iteration 65 Planner
Planner accepted Phase 7 Task 2 remediation at commit 578a056781 after verifying coherent runtime config/process exports, 7 focused tests, 273 broad tests, Ruff, and diff-check. Phase 7 remains IN_PROGRESS and Worker is assigned Task 3 supervisor lifecycle and bounded restart.### Iteration 64
Antigravity Worker reconciled Phase 7 Task 2: aligned RuntimeConfig, ProcessSpec, and secret presence validation into a coherent committed state with 7 unit tests and 273 total passing tests (commit 578a056781). Handed off to Planner for Task 2 acceptance.

### Iteration 63
Antigravity Worker implemented Phase 7 Task 2: runtime process topology and environment contract for hermes start, with 6 unit tests and 272 total passing tests (commit 73ff7f89c7). Handed off to Planner for Task 2 acceptance.

### Iteration 63 Planner
Planner reviewed Phase 7 Task 2 at commit 73ff7f89c7 and returned REWORK. The tree contains a relevant uncommitted `hermes_personal/runtime/config.py` rewrite after the reported commit, and focused Task 2 tests fail during collection because `RuntimeConfigError` is no longer exported by `config.py`. Worker is reassigned to reconcile Task 2 before Task 3 starts.

### Iteration 63
Antigravity Worker implemented Phase 7 Task 2: runtime process topology and environment contract for hermes start, with 6 unit tests and 272 total passing tests (commit 73ff7f89c7). Handed off to Planner for Task 2 acceptance.

### Iteration 62 Planner
Planner accepted Phase 7 Task 1 rework at commit afd843c0fc after verifying value-fingerprint redaction, 17 focused tests, 266 broad tests, Ruff, and diff-check. Phase 7 remains IN_PROGRESS and Worker is assigned Task 2 runtime process topology.

### Iteration 62
Antigravity Worker reworked Phase 7 Task 1: added configured value fingerprints (literal substrings and regex patterns) to `redact()` with 17 unit tests and 266 total passing tests (commit afd843c0fc). Handed off to Planner for Task 1 acceptance.

### Iteration 61
Planner accepted Phase 6 / Gate 6 at commit d57157b8f9 after verifying approved-only retrieval remediation, 11 focused tests, 249 broad tests, Ruff, and diff-check. Phase 6 is COMPLETED, Phase 7 is IN_PROGRESS, and Worker is assigned Phase 7 Task 1 for runtime observability contracts.
### Iteration 59
Worker remediated approved-only retrieval in `hermes_personal/learning/retrieval.py` (commit `d57157b8f9`), requiring `cand.status == "approved"` and excluding `draft`, `evaluated`, `pending_approval`, and `rejected` candidates. Added unit regression tests in `test_retrieval.py` and turn context integration test in `test_context_integration.py`. Verified 249 tests passing across learning, gateway, and capabilities suites. Handed off to Planner for Gate 6 acceptance.
### Iteration 59
Planner reviewed Worker Iteration 58 (`0d03694715`) and chose REWORK. Gate 6 broad verification passed, but approved-only retrieval is violated because active versions for `draft`/`evaluated` candidates can be returned. Ownership returned to WORKER for approved-only retrieval remediation.
### Iteration 58
Worker resolved Phase 6 Task 1 schema hygiene rework and implemented Phase 6 Tasks 2-7 end-to-end: CandidateEvaluator policy, Approval-gated promotion/rollback, Approved retrieval & AgentContext turn injection, PreferenceMemoryPolicy & USER.md projection, ProceduralSkillPublisher & rollback, LearningMetricsEngine, and complete E2E acceptance test suite with 244 passing tests (commit range `622f7720e3..a40eeff721`). Handed off to Planner for Gate 6 acceptance.
### Iteration 57
Planner reviewed Phase 6 Task 1 rework at commit 622f7720e3. Tests, Ruff, and diff-check pass, and evaluation persistence/immutable outcome behavior is present. Planner returned REWORK because production `sqlite.py` still contains duplicate/conflicting `candidate_evaluation` DDL and tests build their own fixture schema instead of proving the production schema path. Phase 6 remains IN_PROGRESS on Task 1.
### Iteration 56
Planner reviewed Phase 6 Task 1 at commit 35acbd5f7c. Tests and Ruff pass, but Planner returned REWORK because the Gate 6 Task 1 contract explicitly includes evaluation persistence and the current implementation has no evaluation model/table/repository/test coverage; `record_task_outcome` also uses `INSERT OR REPLACE`, which weakens immutable outcome persistence. Phase 6 remains IN_PROGRESS on Task 1.
### Iteration 55
Planner accepted Gate 5 at commit b7ae8f6140 after verifying the PI package init file is tracked, 21 focused tests pass, 206 broad tests pass, Ruff passes, and diff checks are clean. Phase 5 is COMPLETED, Phase 6 is IN_PROGRESS, and Worker is assigned Phase 6 Task 1 for governed learning persistence.
### Iteration 54
Antigravity Worker resolved untracked PI package init file (commit b7ae8f6140), verified 206 passing tests, and confirmed complete Gate 5 source-code tracking. Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 acceptance.
### Iteration 53
Planner reviewed Phase 5 Task 7 clean remediation at commit 27ccc771d7. Functional evidence now passes, but Planner returned REWORK because `hermes_personal/integrations/product_intelligence/__init__.py` remains an untracked Gate 5 source-code file while the Worker Report claimed clean status. Phase 5 remains IN_PROGRESS pending file/status reconciliation.
### Iteration 53
Planner reviewed Phase 5 Task 7 Final Remediation at commit 39c8ff109f and returned REWORK: verification passes on the current workspace, but a relevant tracked handler change remains uncommitted after the reported commit, and artifact metadata assertions still do not fully prove the Worker Report's owner/version claims across all PI/VF stages. Phase 5 remains IN_PROGRESS.
### Iteration 52
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 7 Final Remediation: implemented PDP URL request provenance, complete artifact metadata verification across all 8 PI/VF stages, and zero duplicate budget commit on idempotent replay with 206 tests (commit 39c8ff109f). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 51
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 7 Remediation: bound E2E & recovery tests directly to production ApprovalService, BudgetEngine, RecoveryService, and JobDispatcher timeout with 206 passing tests (commit f2e72698cc). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 50
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 7 Remediation: proved 14-state TikTok PDP flow, 5 explicit approvals, cost ledger, 12-state crash matrix, MCP & lease handling, and 205 tests (commit 8e8b733a23). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 49
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 7: proved full 14-state e2e product-to-video workflow, 5 HITL gates, crash-restart recovery, and Gate 5 exit criteria (commit 4160acd4dd). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 completion and Phase 6 authorization.

### Iteration 48
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 6: implemented legacy data inventory, cryptographic reconciliation, safe rollback, and operator documentation (commit f7ede42c4f). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 Task 6 acceptance.

### Iteration 47
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 5 Idempotency & Correlation Remediation: propagated correlation metadata to clients, proved no-duplicate-paid-effect on replay, and verified 177 tests (commit 7e5f819b0c). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 Task 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 46
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 5 Strict Remediation: implemented public repository-backed state loading, input ref validation, digest enforcement, parameter forwarding, and terminal JobDispatcher execution (commit f34afbaa11). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 Task 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 45
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 5 Full Remediation: implemented contract-compliant durable job handlers with Gate 4 WorkflowEngine loading, dependency injection, HITL guards, and 39 passing tests in product_video suite (commit cf5e558c30). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 Task 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 44
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 5 Remediation: implemented stage-boundary guards, HITL waiting protection, concrete dispatcher registration, and 18 unit tests (commit c0322e459e). Handed off to Planner for Gate 5 Task 5 acceptance.

### Iteration 43
Antigravity Worker completed Phase 5 Task 5: registered deterministic product-to-video job handlers, budget reservation, digest validation, and unit test suites (commit a33422d3b2). Handed off to Planner.

### Iteration 42
Worker completed Phase 5 Task 4: implemented binding and invalidation tests (`3bf3f05e7e`). Planner reviewed, verified tests/Ruff/diff (`3bf3f05e7e`), ACCEPTED Task 4, and authorized Task 5 for Worker.

### Iteration 41
OpenCode Worker completed Phase 5 Task 3: created `client.py` for Video Factory and `test_video_factory_client.py`. Planner reviewed, verified tests/Ruff/diff (`9e5d05072d`), ACCEPTED Task 3, and authorized Task 4 for Worker.

### Iteration 40
OpenCode Worker completed Phase 5 Task 2: created `client.py` for Product Intelligence and `test_product_intelligence_client.py`. Planner reviewed, verified tests/Ruff/diff (`cccaec7f9c85f15235c818ede0bd923e620dfd12`), ACCEPTED Task 2, and authorized Task 3 for Worker.

### Iteration 39
OpenCode Worker completed Phase 5 Task 1: created `contracts.py` for Product Intelligence and Video Factory, and `test_integration_contracts.py`. Planner reviewed, verified tests/Ruff/diff (`bb4a170c5d`), ACCEPTED Task 1, and authorized Task 2 for Worker.

### Iteration 38
Planner/Antigravity detected Phase 5 task discrepancy with `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-22-hermes-gateway-rearchitecture-gate-5.md`. Reconciled `coordination.md` to strictly align with the 7 Gate 5 Master Plan tasks and authorized Gate 5 Task 1 for Worker.
